                Adventure in Titiru is so many things: Visit islands, go diving,
                see birds, coral reefs and abundant fish and un-spoilt beauty of
                tiny islands and extinct volcanoes dotted through emerald
                lagoons. <br /> Titiru is the ancient protective spirit of
                Rendova. You will see culture and experience the ancient ways of
                island life through cultural demonstrations and visits to sacred
                sites.
